# Math Camp 2019

This repository contains materials for UWâ€“Madison Political Science Math Camp (Fall 2019 incoming cohort). Instructors are Micah Dillard and Anton Shirikov. 

# For students

Materials for students include lectures and practice problems. 

**Slides** can be found in the `/lectures/` folder. There are two ways to view these slides. 

- The easiest way is to use the PDF files. PDFs of the slides can be found in the `/lectures/pdf/`  folder. These files will be viewable online, but you should download them *all the way* to your computer. The files should open in the Preview or Adobe Reader applications, depending on your computer. 

- For technical reasons, these slides are designed to be viewed in a web browser (like Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Internet Explorer, etc.). This makes the slides look a bit nicer (mainly the math). If you want to view them this way, you should download the entire course repository (either as a `.zip` archive, or by cloning the repository using `git`) and open the HTML versions of the slides in your web browser. 

**Practice problems** can be found in the `/exercises/` folder. Each exercise set has a PDF file. Use these.
