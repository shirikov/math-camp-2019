# R is a REPL (read, evaluate, print, loop).
# This means that it executes commands and returns results *one at a time*

# Results are printed in the CONSOLE.
# The console can be displayed...
# - in the R application (R.app on Mac, R.exe on Windows)
# - in the Rstudio application (on Mac or Windows)
# - or as a terminal program

# to demonstrate, R can perform simple math.
# Type the following commands directly into the console
